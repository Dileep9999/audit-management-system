        ('control_weakness', 'Control Weakness'),
        ('risk_exposure', 'Risk Exposure'),
        ('best_practice', 'Best Practice'),
    ])
    severity = models.CharField(choices=[
        ('low', 'Low'),
        ('medium', 'Medium'), 
        ('high', 'High'),
        ('critical', 'Critical'),
    ])
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
    evidence = models.ManyToManyField(AuditEvidence)
    recommendations = models.TextField()
    due_date = models.DateTimeField()
    assigned_to = models.ForeignKey(User)
    status = models.CharField(choices=[
        ('open', 'Open'),
        ('in_progress', 'In Progress'),
        ('resolved', 'Resolved'),
        ('closed', 'Closed'),
    ])
```

#### Frontend Components
1. **FindingsManager Component**
2. **CreateFinding Modal**
3. **FindingDetails Component**
4. **RecommendationTracker**

### Phase 4: Advanced Reporting

#### Components to Build
1. **TaskCompletionReport**
   - Checklist responses summary
   - Evidence attachments
   - Review comments
   - Completion timeline

2. **AuditProgressReport**
   - Overall audit status
   - Task completion rates
   - Findings summary
   - Resource utilization

3. **ComplianceReport**
   - Compliance status by area
   - Risk assessments
   - Corrective actions needed

### Phase 5: Notification & Communication

#### Notification Triggers
- Task completion ‚Üí Notify reviewer
- Evidence uploaded ‚Üí Notify verifier
- Review completed ‚Üí Notify task owner
- Finding created ‚Üí Notify responsible party
- Due dates approaching ‚Üí Notify assignees

#### Communication Features

3. **Basic Reporting** - Needed for audit documentation

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Findings Management** - Important for compliance tracking
2. **Advanced Notifications** - Improves workflow efficiency
3. **Comment System** - Enhances collaboration

### Low Priority (Future)

## User Experience Flow

### Typical Post-Completion Workflow:

1. **User completes checklist** ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
2. **User adds evidence per field** üìé ‚úÖ **INTEGRATED**
   - Upload supporting documents directly in each field
   - Add screenshots/photos with descriptions
   - Attach relevant files with evidence types
   ‚Üì
3. **Evidence verification** ‚úîÔ∏è
   - Senior auditor reviews evidence
   - Approves or requests additional evidence
   ‚Üì
4. **Task review** üëÅÔ∏è
   - Reviewer examines responses and evidence
   - Approves task or requests revisions
   ‚Üì
5. **Findings identification** üîç
   - Create findings for any issues discovered
   - Assign corrective actions
   ‚Üì
6. **Reporting** üìä
   - Generate task completion report
   - Update audit progress
   - Notify stakeholders

## Technical Considerations

### API Endpoints Needed
```
POST /api/audit-tasks/{id}/evidence/
GET /api/audit-tasks/{id}/evidence/
POST /api/audit-tasks/{id}/submit-for-review/
GET /api/audit-tasks/{id}/reviews/
POST /api/audit-tasks/{id}/approve/
POST /api/audit-tasks/{id}/reject/
POST /api/audit-tasks/{id}/findings/
GET /api/audit-tasks/{id}/reports/
```

### Database Considerations
- File storage for evidence uploads
- Audit trail for all actions
- Soft deletes for data integrity
- Indexing for performance

### Security & Permissions
- Role-based access control
- Evidence encryption
- Audit logging
- Data retention policies

## Success Metrics

### Completion Metrics
- Time from checklist completion to final approval
- Evidence upload rates
- Review turnaround times
- Finding resolution rates

### Quality Metrics
- Review rejection rates
- Evidence verification success
- Finding recurrence rates
- User satisfaction scores

## Conclusion

The next steps after checklist completion involve a comprehensive workflow of evidence collection, review, findings management, and reporting. This creates a complete audit trail and ensures thorough documentation of the audit process.

The implementation should be phased to deliver immediate value while building toward a complete audit management solution.
