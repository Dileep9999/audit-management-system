# Audit Task Integration System

This document describes the comprehensive audit task management system that integrates the checklist functionality into the audit management workflow.

## Overview

The audit task system bridges the audit management and checklist systems, allowing auditors to:
- Create structured audit tasks using checklist templates
- Track task progress and completion
- Manage evidence collection
- Monitor audit progress with real-time dashboards

- `priority`: low, medium, high, critical
- `control_area`: Specific audit control area

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Tasks inherit audit permissions
- Evidence can only be added by assigned users
- Verification requires appropriate permissions

### Data Integrity
- Task-checklist relationship is one-to-one
- Evidence linked to specific tasks
- Audit trail for all task activities

### File Security
- Evidence files stored securely
- Access logged and monitored
- File type validation

## Performance Optimization

### Database Queries
- Select related for efficient loading
- Indexed fields for fast filtering
- Pagination for large task lists

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy loading of task details
- Efficient state management
- Optimized re-renders

### Caching
- Template data cached
- Progress calculations cached
- Evidence metadata cached

### Settings Configuration
```python
# Add to INSTALLED_APPS if not already present
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing apps
    'apps.audits',
    'apps.checklists',
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tasks not appearing:**
- Check audit permissions
- Verify checklist template exists
- Ensure user has access to audit

**Evidence upload failing:**
- Check file size limits
- Verify file type permissions
- Ensure storage backend configured

**Progress not updating:**
- Refresh task data
- Check checklist completion
- Verify task-checklist link

### Debugging

**Enable debug logging:**
```python
LOGGING = {
    'loggers': {
        'apps.audits': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'handlers': ['console'],
        }
    }
}
```

**Check task creation:**
```python
from apps.audits.models import AuditTask
from apps.checklists.models import Checklist

# Verify task-checklist relationship
task = AuditTask.objects.get(id=123)
print(f"Task: {task.task_name}")
print(f"Checklist: {task.checklist.name}")
print(f"Progress: {task.get_completion_percentage()}%")
```
